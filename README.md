# [DeepPumas for viral dynamics workshop](https://pumasai-labs.github.io/ViralDynamicsWorkshop/)

This repository holds everything we need for the PumasAI workshop in Bordeaux 2026.

To see the course introduction and slides, head to [**the workshop website**](https://pumasai-labs.github.io/ViralDynamicsWorkshop/).

To run the hands-on exercises,

- Fire up a DeepPumas app in [juliahub.com](https://juliahub.com/)
  - You should have received a coupon code in your email. This code will give you credits and access to the DeepPumas app.
  - When launching the DeepPumas app, use "launch custom instance" and select 16vCPU and a 9h time limit.
- Wait a minute for the VSCode view to pop up in your browser.
- Clone this repository either
  - In the **GUI**
    1. Bring up the command pallette (`Ctrl+shift+p`, or from the cogwheel in the bottom left corner)
    1. Search for `git clone`
    1. clone `https://github.com/PumasAI-Labs/ViralDynamicsWorkshop.git`
  - or, in the terminal **terminal**
    1. If you don't have a terminal, open one by searching for `Terminal: focus on terminal view` in the command pallette.
    1. Navigate to `~/data/code`
    1. Clone using `git clone https://github.com/PumasAI-Labs/ViralDynamicsWorkshop.git`
