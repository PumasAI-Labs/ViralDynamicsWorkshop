## Workshop Materials

This workshop explores how to combine mechanistic modeling with machine learning using DeepPumas for viral dynamics applications.

To follow along in the presentations, just navigate to any relevant bits from here.

### Getting the code to run the hands-on exercises

- Fire up a DeepPumas app in [juliahub.com](https://juliahub.com/)
  - You should have received a coupon code in your email. This code will give you credits and access to the DeepPumas app.
  - When launching the DeepPumas app, use "launch custom instance" and select 16vCPU and a 9h time limit.
- Wait a minute for the VSCode view to pop up in your browser.
- Clone this repository either
  - In the **GUI**
    1. Bring up the command pallette (`Ctrl+shift+p`, or from the cogwheel in the bottom left corner)
    1. Search for `git clone`
    1. clone `https://github.com/PumasAI-Labs/ViralDynamicsWorkshop.git`
  - or, in the terminal **terminal**
    1. If you don't have a terminal, open one by searching for `Terminal: focus on terminal view` in the command pallette.
    1. Navigate to `~/data/code`
    1. Clone using `git clone https://github.com/PumasAI-Labs/ViralDynamicsWorkshop.git`
